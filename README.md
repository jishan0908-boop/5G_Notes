# 5G_Notes
About , wireless communication and how it works 

# Chapter 1 : The 5G System
# 1.  Standardization

The motive to make the standardization of techonolgy was come , because of some difficulties , like : 1. It was tough for any one if he or she tarvel to differnt country and found differnt technologies . 2. It was expensive also that to coop-up with other country technoloy .
Because of these problems , we have to come=up with the ideas of standardization which  helps to bring the nations togethere.


## 1. Who defines what is 5G :
This moto was then intorduce by United Nation , where specifically comes under ITU(International Telecomunication Union).
ITU was established in 1865 , as the International Telegraph Union , but later on it change to  International Telecomunication Union. This agency is respondsible for the development of new telecommuntiaction technology and implementing it on all over the world.

Under ITU there are three more sub-divisions :
1. ITU-T :
   This is the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector , which works on Cyber-Security sector , Machine-Learning sector  and Video comprestion sector.
2. ITU-R :
   This is the ITU Radiocommunication Sector , which is the most important sector for ITU . Thids sectro is responsible for the 5G technolgy , space radio technology and wireless communticatons.
3. ITU-D :
   This is the ITU Telecommunication Development Sector , which works over to create polices , regulation , and trainuing protocals , for all over the world.
# 5G:
## IMT 2020:
International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020 Standard) are the requirements issued by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R). This are the requirerment or we can say standards ginven by the ITU , to achive 5G.

1. Peak Data Rate(Gbits/s):
   This requirement is defined for the purpose of evaluation in the eMBB(Enhanced Mobile Broadban) usage scenario. The minimum requirements for peak data rate are as follows: – Downlink peak data rate is 20 Gbit/s. – Uplink peak data rate is 10 Gbit/s.

2. User Experienced Data Rate(Mbit/s):
   The target user experienced data rate for IMT-2020 5G is 100 Mbps for downlink and 50 Mbps for uplink.

3. Spcetrum Efficiency:
   5G technologies also promise to provide significant gains in spectral efficiency, enabling peak speeds that exceed 30 bits per second (bps) per Hertz (Hz).

4. Mobility(Km/h):
   This is the requirement that how fast the speed of network to work. The target is of 500Km/h .

5. Latency(ms):
   This requirement works over the delay of the packets , from one server to another . The target is to make it (million per second).

6. Connection Density:
   This requirement is deifend as  how many user can be coverd in per square kilometer , where the target is of 10 to the power 6 per square kilometer.

7. Network Energy Efficiency :
   This requirement is also important that how much energy is requied to run 5G on a moblie , where the target is 100x times.

8. Area Traffic(Mbit/s/m2):
   This requiremnet is for the network handling per meter square area.


# 2. Who actually designs 5G:

The standards are given byu ITU , but to full fill these requierment , 3GPP(3rd Generation Partnership Project) , which works to exceute 5G technology , also there is competive group present 3GPP2( 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 ) which is developing and alter native solutions . But , in 5G 3GPP has made more succses . 

## 3GPP: 
 3rd Generation Partnership Project   , have is the organisation of several differnt countries like , Japan , United Nation of America , India  ,China , South Korea , Europe and some Private oraginsation which work together to achive these requirments.

3GPP has sub three division which works on three diffrent projects:
1. T5G RAN( Radio Access Network)
2. T5G CT(Core Network & Terminals)
3. T5G ST( Service & Systems Aspects)

## Relation between ITU & 3GPP :
Where ITU give evalution and requiremnet to 3GPP , where 3GPP start evaluations and solutions for the requirements , check the systems working and evalution and studies the requirements needed to full fill , then after complition it handed to IMT 2020 Specification where they check that , it is full filling the requirement or not.

# 2. The 5G Use Cases 
## What are the use cases that 5G is design fo ?

This quite difficult to define the feature that will sevreve use cases of 5G.

BUT  WE HAVE A 3D PYRAMIND WHICH COVERS SOME ASPECTS 
1. ENCHANCED MOBLIE BORADBAND
2. MASSIVE MACHINE TYPE COMMUNICTAIONS
3. ULTRA-RELIABLE AND LOW LATENCY COMMUNICATIONS

## ENCHANCED MOBLIE BORADBAN
This is the first use case , where it handles moblies or network traffics in bulk. The traffics of videos , where in 4G we use to use HD qualtiy videos but, In 5G we can see videos in 4K/8K quality , 3D videos or may be Virtual Reality , to watch such a videos  we need more capable network like 5G.
Things that are needed to Achive are:
1. Peak Data Rate : Where we need 20Gbps(Downloading link ) and 10Gbps(Uploading link).
2. Peak Spectrum Efficency : This is  important because to wider the broadband width more user can use it , where it needs 30 bps/Hz (Downloading link) and 15 bps/Hz ( Uploading link).
3. User experienced data rate  : It will defines the speed of the data transfer to the user 100 Mbps (Downloading link) and 50 Mbps (Uploading link).
4. Mobility : If the user is travelling with a high speed he need a fast data speed which is Up to 500 Km/h.
5. Energy Efficency : This is also one of the important aspcets becauise we cannot increase the battery size , of our moblie so we need to work , on that 5G use less energy .
6. More use cases like , in Smart Phones, Home , venues and enterprises and ( 4k / 8k videos , UHD , Broadbands etc.)
 ## MASSIVE MACHINE TYPE COMMUNICTAIONS
 This case need very little data and very less frequently , but need long battery life . This type of case we can see in smart cities where , we take and example like garbage trash cans, when they are filled a signal or data is to be trannsfer to the depeartment like a 1 bit data , which can then empty the trash cans but need longer battery so that it work for years.
Things that are needed to Achive are:
1. Density: The density here means , to cover more are of user , like 1000000 devices per sq Km2.
2. Battery: The battery life is most important aspect of this case we , need battery life  upto 10-15 years.
3. Low Data Rate: As we see the above example , we have to transfer 1 bit data or max to 100kbps.
4. More use cases like, Smart Buildings , Logistics , tracking , smart electercity meter needs ( also we need to wrok like , we these meter are in basement the data should transfer properly), Industrial application etc.

## ULTRA-RELIABLE AND LOW LATENCY COMMUNICATIONS
This case is also an important case where we need , high reliablity and low latency nearly 100% and garenty of data .Example like , self driving cars , cars should be connected to each other so that they can communicate with each other , and share 100% of data so that chnaces of accidents can be reduces.
Things that are needed to Achive are:
1. Low User Plane Latency : This need of 1 mili second . The data should be transfer very fast .
2. Low Reliablity: This should be need upto 99.9999% so that chances of accidents can be reduce.
3. Mobility Interruption Time : This is needed to 0ms .
4. More use cases like, Traffic safety , Remote manufacturing , training , surgery etc.

# THE 5G SYSTEM 
To understand how 5G system works , in video we have given an example , where there is user's smartphone which is searching somethings on google .
were their are three stages or sets, rule we can say from which they can access the google .
1. Access Network
2. Core Network
3. Data Network

## Access Network:
5G Radio Access Network , which is based on a technology called as New Radio or NR , it's responsible for providing Wwireless communication to the device.

## Core Network:
The core network in this case us 5G network , responsible for the mobility management , subscription management and secuirty management.

## Data Network:
This is simply the internet in this case.

![NETWORK WORKING](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76b26962-05f8-4a90-9970-30d654590661)

N2 : Here N2 , control the communication  with AMF.
N3 : Here N3 , is the Data Plane Communicate with UPF.
N4 : Here N4 , establish the communication with UPF & SMF.

The rest of the core network function communicate with each other as a microservices.

## The 5G Network can be represented in two forms:
## FIRST FORM: REFERENCE POINT REPRESENTATION
![refernce point](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a43134e5-961b-444b-8133-059d817dbb16)

## SECOND FROM: SERVICE BASE  REPRESENTATION

![second point](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/686c22b7-0264-4ad9-929e-567f029bc662)



Since,  5G uses services base architecture.
We have different ends of devices using  5G network  on one end at the 5G user, Massive MTC is present , which are the large number of devices which send very little data, if these kind of devices are dominate the network then , there we have to scale control signals infrastucture . On the other hand we have Moblie Broadband devices which creates the large demands in the user plane functions because there is lot if data if , but there are only fewer devices , so these devices are dominating than we need to scale the user plane function not control plane signals . So if there is no separation in user and control plane functions , then we would end up scaling the loads handling to both user and control plane , which is inefficent way of scaling .
We separate with the demanding of user or control plane function which one is  needed to scale. Separating these , give freedom to apply differnt function in different geographical region.

## KEY NETWORK FUNCTIONS:

## 1. gNodeB : 
The main function of gNodeB , is to provide wireless connectiviy in 5G devices , in an efficent manner.

## 2. UPF :
The main function of UPF , is to provides interface towards internet . This is good place  to enforcing polcies to ensure the devices doesn't exceeds the data . Also we can call it , the mobility , anchoring point for enforcement of polices and lawful interception .

## 3. SMF :
Session Mangaemenet  Function , it gives the device an IP Address when the device has finshed the activity . 

## 4. AMF :
Access and Mobility Function, it forwards the sessions releated information to SMF. The primary responsiblty for supporting the devices to move between two radio cells in addition , it is responsible for the establishing the encrypted signals connection towards the devices . so that the device can be registered itself , and get authenticate , so that it is ready to accsess on internet.

## 5. AUSF :
Actual Security information Algorithms . This is the part of authentication Server function or , ASUF which support the AMF with the authencated function during the different process.

## 6. UDM :
Unified Data Management and Unified Data Repositroy . The User Subscription Data is stored in Unified Data Repository . UDM is the forntend of the user subscription data . it support AMF  in access of the Autherisation , registor management for the devices etc.

## 7. PCF :
Policy Control Function , Charging related function depending on the usage by the device.PCF provides two kind of policies support . first , the policy related to Session Management , for example , certain kind of traffices is supported or not supported their and Second policy is related to non session management they are like mobility policy example , the device may not have rights to access the network in certain geographical area.

# 5G DEPLOYMENT OPTIONs

## OPTION 1:
For the perspective of 5G & 4G , can be consider as the legacy option , first we have eNodeB which is connected to EPC( 4G Core ).
![option 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a363dca-5000-402d-8ea8-096fe7cd145a)


## OPTION 2:
When we have 5G Radio Access Network ,connected to 5G Core network is the option 2 , it is useful for those operator who does not have the legacy of 4G netwrok.
![option 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04d02d82-5683-49dc-bb6e-e4bf5a41e914)


## OPTION 3: EN-DC ( E-UTRAN NEW RADIO - DUAL CONNECTIVIYTY )
Both 4G & 5G exist , this is when a smartphone is connected to ,two differnt techonoly , it is called Dual-Connectivity , Because it is connected to two Radio Acces Network .

In the elustration we have a smartphone which is connected to both eNodeB and gNodeB, in such a situation , one Access technology is known as Mater Radio Access Technology and other is called Secondary Radio Access Technology .

The Radio Network with provide control signaling is called Master Radio Access Technology and other which is use for data things is Secondary Radion Access Technology. We know 4G as primary and 5G as secondary and  the Core Network us the 4G Core network , The option is particularly relevant to the operator who does not have 5G Core Network . But want to use 5 Network then they has 5G RAN .

## OPTION 3 IS ALSO SUB-DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS 3 , 3a ,3x :

## 3 :
In this option the core network is of 4G , where the data is transfer to directly to the eNodeB , and then subsituit into two part on goes to the gNodeB and other to smartphones . Here we have tri-netwrok circut of data transfer where data can be transfer to eNodeB to gNodeB or vica versa .

![3 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d828e4bb-4a79-4ecb-8e75-e674e4ecdd83)

## 3a :
In this option the core netwrok is of 4G , where in this option that data is directly transfer to the 5G RAN and there is no data transfer between , 4G and 5G RAN .This is a disadvantage because , the data cannot be share between 4G AND 5G RAN .

![3a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39e57dbc-b641-4bcf-99d1-79046987a164)

## 3x :
Tn this option , it is the proper example of option 3 , which have all the same property of option 3.

![option 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8795e80-0df1-48d0-b597-f26748a32850)


## OPTION 4 NE-DC :
In this option the Core Network is of 5G and the Master Radio Access Technology is gNodeB and Secondary Radio Access Technology is eNodeB .This option also have two sub-parts.


![option 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78afe20d-2b0b-4a5e-9d71-6d8714df750c)


## 4 :
In this option there is a tri-circut connection between gNodeB , eNodeB and smartphone . Where data can be transfer between gNodeB to eNodeB and vica versa .


![4, 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fe6103-f34e-40e2-96ba-4dac68d1e0cf)

## 4a :
In this option there is no tri-connection , the data is directly transfer form 5G Core Netwrok to eNodeB . This is a disadvantage options , because the data is not circulate between RAN.
Also , in this case 4G access should be dirsctly connected to 5G Core Network , because of  some 5G polices , So therefore We have to update the software of 4G Base Station.


![4a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b1fb92-693b-441c-89af-f702e7bf0d2d)

## OPTION 5 eLTE:
There 4G Radio Access Technology with and enhanced version and it is directly to the 5G Core Network .

![option 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc564405-37d6-4fb0-a79e-d1398f29b567)

## OPTION 6:
Smilarly in this option we have Core Network of 4G  and 5G Radio Access Technology . But there is some issue , However during standardization process of 5G device , they will not support this configuration , there is noway that the device can have connection to 5G gNodeB which has only access to 4G Core Network , so the option is no longer relevant.

![option 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1985de7-d5d3-4240-8dfa-cf627fd18a5d)

## OPTION 7 NG-EN-DC :
In this option we have Core Network of 5G , where Master Radio Access Technology is 4G eLTE and Secondary Radio Access Technology is 5G gNodeB. 

![option 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feafb821-1c51-4c41-b49e-b6be29fa6cfc)

## NON STANDALONE ( NSA ) AND STANDALONE ( SA ) DEPLOYMENTS:

Where we have a sinlge technology in both Radio Access Netwrok and in Core Network , that is called as Standalone deploymenet .
Example : Option 1 and Option 2.

Where we have a combinations of 4G & 5G Technology in Radio Access Netwrok and in Core Network , that is called as Non-Standalone deployment.
Example : Option 3 , Option 4 and Option 7.

# Chapter 2 : 5G NR( NEW RADIO ): RAN ( RADIO ACCESS NETWORK ) gNodeB

## PAN Protocol Stack 
There are two RAN Protocol Stack :

1. User Plane Protocol Stack .

   The User Plane Protocol Stack supports or the arriving of the user data between different application in UE and Netwrok.
   
3. Control Plane Protocol Stack .

   The Control Plane Protocol Stack can been seen carrying control information in between UE and to gNodeB or to Core Network.

## User Plane Protocol Stack 

![upps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd94de7e-09fd-4c9c-981b-084005956076)


Each layer provide services to above layer and consumes the services of below layer .

Example: RLC provides services to PDCP and uses the services of MAC.

## PHY : 
PHY ( Physical ) , this is the efficent way of wireless coommunication . Here , Bits and Bytes are transimited efficently passing through Wwireless Channels.

## MAC :
MAC ( Medium Access Control ) , it provide retransmission (looking for errors) , multiplexing.demultiplexing , scheduling and also , provides fast feedbacks to error .

## RLC :
RLC ( Radio Link Control ) ,  where ARQ represents breaking up of complete data  into IP packets in small packet , this process is called Segmentation. In the transmission side and putting  them back togethere , this process is called reassembly .

## PDCP :
PDCP ( Packet Data Convergence Protocol ) , in this layer IP packets are design for user communication over a wireless communcation , so certain precautions should be taken , first the IP Header has a lot of information that is no longer necessary so Header IP is compressed . 

## SDAP :
SDAP ( Service Data Adaptation Protocol ) , it is responsible for the mapping of QoS bearer into the right radio bearer according to QoS requirement .

![example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16889cde-e2f0-4388-8323-94baa9472c53)

## Control Plane Protocol Stack 

![cpps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0445551c-d807-4a7e-9cea-ddde30b6de7e)

## NAS :
NAS ( Non-Access Stratum ) , Authentication , Security , Idel mode procedures .

## RRC : 
RRC ( Radio Resource Control ) , System information , Radio Bearer , Measuerment configuration .

# SDAP ( Service Data Adaptation Protocol ) :

5G , Supports variety of Services .

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3205331b-5c36-407d-a490-c53be881723f)

## QoS : 
Ability to provide different priority to different application , users or data flows or to guarantee a certain level of performace

## Qos flows : QFI : 
Packets are classified and marked using an ID called QOS identifier or QFI ; using these packets with certain QFI can recieve cooresponding treatment used to differentiate package from different kinds of services

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6884eeb-e327-4904-8ad0-044869be73d8)

# QoS Flow are of Three types :

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1688e4b8-e63e-4b73-a1dd-8c44467a892c)

## GBR :
GBR ( Guarenteed Bitrate ) , voice comm requires GBR so voice doesnt get disrupted.

## NGBR :
NGBR ( Non-Guarenteed Bitrate ) , browseing required NGBR , because in browseing traffices are more busty in nature .

## Delay Critical :
Delay Critical , are use for machein critical application , ex self driving robots etc.
