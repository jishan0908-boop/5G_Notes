# 5G_Notes
About , wireless communication and how it works 

# Chapter 1 : Standardization
The motive to make the standardization of techonolgy was come , because of some difficulties , like : 1. It was tough for any one if he or she tarvel to differnt country and found differnt technologies . 2. It was expensive also that to coop-up with other country technoloy .
Because of these problems , we have to come=up with the ideas of standardization which  helps to bring the nations togethere.


## 1. Who defines what is 5G :
This moto was then intorduce by United Nation , where specifically comes under ITU(International Telecomunication Union).
ITU was established in 1865 , as the International Telegraph Union , but later on it change to  International Telecomunication Union. This agency is respondsible for the development of new telecommuntiaction technology and implementing it on all over the world.

Under ITU there are three more sub-divisions :
1. ITU-T :
   This is the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector , which works on Cyber-Security sector , Machine-Learning sector  and Video comprestion sector.
2. ITU-R :
   This is the ITU Radiocommunication Sector , which is the most important sector for ITU . Thids sectro is responsible for the 5G technolgy , space radio technology and wireless communticatons.
3. ITU-D :
   This is the ITU Telecommunication Development Sector , which works over to create polices , regulation , and trainuing protocals , for all over the world.
# 5G:
## IMT 2020:
International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020 Standard) are the requirements issued by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R). This are the requirerment or we can say standards ginven by the ITU , to achive 5G.

1. Peak Data Rate(Gbits/s):
   This requirement is defined for the purpose of evaluation in the eMBB(Enhanced Mobile Broadban) usage scenario. The minimum requirements for peak data rate are as follows: – Downlink peak data rate is 20 Gbit/s. – Uplink peak data rate is 10 Gbit/s.

2. User Experienced Data Rate(Mbit/s):
   The target user experienced data rate for IMT-2020 5G is 100 Mbps for downlink and 50 Mbps for uplink.

3. Spcetrum Efficiency:
   5G technologies also promise to provide significant gains in spectral efficiency, enabling peak speeds that exceed 30 bits per second (bps) per Hertz (Hz).

4. Mobility(Km/h):
   This is the requirement that how fast the speed of network to work. The target is of 500Km/h .

5. Latency(ms):
   This requirement works over the delay of the packets , from one server to another . The target is to make it (million per second).

6. Connection Density:
   This requirement is deifend as  how many user can be coverd in per square kilometer , where the target is of 10 to the power 6 per square kilometer.

7. Network Energy Efficiency :
   This requirement is also important that how much energy is requied to run 5G on a moblie , where the target is 100x times.

8. Area Traffic(Mbit/s/m2):
   This requiremnet is for the network handling per meter square area.
